 ### Overview
 Welcome to my first html & css project from [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io).
 I had *so* much fun!

 ### The challenge
 The challenge was to re-create a simple html and css static page that held a QR code.

### Screenshot

### Links
Link to the [QR code component Project](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/qr-code-component-iux_sIO_H/hub).

### My process

I constantly referanced the preview image provided.
I'm sure there are better processes out there and I'm sure I'll learn which is the most helpful as I progress as a developer.

### Built with 

Built with basic html and css in VSCode. 

### What I learned

I now have a better understanding of how parent elements and child elements work. 
I'll mess up a lot, but eventually I'll get it right.<br>
Make -> fail -> make -> fail -> make!

### Continued developemnt

None on this project.
